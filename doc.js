How does Next.js differ from a traditional React application ?

  Ans : Next.js Apple's React enhances SSG (server-side generation) and SSR (Static Site Generation). Which helps improve SEO and load speed. So the page is no longer the same as a typical React App, where everything is done on the client side, the page can also be rendered beforehand. Moreover, it includes in-the-box file structure-based routing, so third-party routers are not necessary either. Also integrating APIs gets easier with its API routes feature. In short, it is straightforward to say that it can potentially enhance the performance of React web applications.


What are the advantages of using Next.js for server - side rendering ?

  Ans : Using Next.js for server - side rendering(SSR) means faster page loads since the content is generated on the server and sent to the browser, reducing the time users wait.It boosts SEO because search engines can easily crawl fully rendered pages.You also get better performance on slower devices since less work is done on the client side.Plus, SSR enhances user experience with content being ready as soon as the page loads.Overall, it’s great for building more dynamic, high - performing web apps.



    

Explain the difference between SSR and SSG.

  Ans : SSR(Server - Side Rendering) generates the page on each request, meaning the server creates the HTML every time a user visits.This is great for dynamic content that changes often.SSG(Static Site Generation), on the other hand, pre - builds the HTML at build time, so the same static page is served to every user, which is super fast for content that doesn’t change frequently.SSR is real - time, while SSG is more like a snapshot.Both have their perks, depending on how fresh or static your content needs
